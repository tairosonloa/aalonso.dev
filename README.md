## About this repository

This is my personal website I made from scratch using React and TypeScript.
I use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework to develop it.

I started this development after graduating from University and started to
work for [Acid Tango](https://acidtango.com/), where I acquired more
professional skills and better programming and design practices. Before
that, I had another site made with GatbsyJS I used during my student
years, with a lot of technical debt because of my learning process. The old archive repo can be found [here](https://github.com/tairosonloa/aalonso.eu).
